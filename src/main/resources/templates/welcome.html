            War is a card game for player and AI. A standard deck of 52 cards is dealt so that both player and AI have 26 cards.
            <br> During each round of play (or "battle"), both player and AI play a card from the top of their hand face up.
            The player who plays the card of the higher rank wins both cards and places them at the bottom of his stack of
            cards. <br> If both cards played are of the same rank then you just both keep your card.
